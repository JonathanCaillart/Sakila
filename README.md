  # Difficulties 
    Re-Learn the php without framework like laravel
    No enought use of php outside of work
    Didn't really like php (personal point of view only, has nothing do to with the test)
    Had to ask frequently devweb class friends like Jean Masso, Fabrice Dujardin and Willy Saike due to their use of php at work and experiences
    Yet one of the most challenging project for me because of knowledge : I see how to do it in my mind but need to search how code it
    
  Miscellaneous 
  Recently someone has try to hack my GitHub account, i don't know why . He didn't managed to find my password so he asked for an password reset, i changed it by safety...
